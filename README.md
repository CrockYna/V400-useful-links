# V400-useful-links
Simple repo containing links useful for printing with FLSUN V400, got from anywhere on the web<p>
Hotend change: https://www.lesimprimantes3d.fr/forum/topic/49962-flsun-v400-hotend-upgrade-trianglelab-chc-pro-bondtech-cht-volcano/ <p>
Printer board: (mine is a nano v2.1 with GD32F303, which is a clone of MKS robin nano v2. I assume the board schema is almost the same.): https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-Robin-Nano-V2.X/wiki/Wiring_Pinout_and_Size <p> 

# Air filtering
* A good filter, originally for Voron printers: https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro <p>
* About enclosures: https://howto3dprint.net/the-ultimate-guide-to-3d-printer-enclosures/ <p>
About particle emission in 3D printing:<p>
* https://all3dp.com/1/3d-printing-emissions-air-quality/ <p>
* https://howto3dprint.net/3d-printer-fumes/#hepa-high-efficiency-particulate-air-filters <p>
Sensor that can detect PM0.1 particles (ultra fine particles starting at 0.1um and below: this is the range where 3D printing emits...): <p>
